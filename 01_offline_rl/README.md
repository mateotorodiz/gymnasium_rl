# Offline RL subrepo
## About
This subrepo aims to use offline-RL algorithms to again solve basic gym or custom envs. 
## Purpose
This repo is intended for my personal learning, and therefore has the minimum structure to be understandable for me. If you are interested in the contents, feel free to contact my university email (known to coworkers) or LinkedIn (for those of you who know me personally but no longer work in the university, who by the way I have already written to in LinkedIn ;) ).

## Learning Plan
1. Translate my gained knowledge from Gym & Stable Baselines to scope-rl
2. Grasp the offline-RL problem better, the statistics background makes it hard to understand for me
3. Find out how to tune/select algorithms for simple offline RL problems
